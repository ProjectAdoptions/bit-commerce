    <h4>1. Submit product details</h4>
    <p>Simply pickup one or a few files from your <a href="https://www.dropbox.com" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>
    account, provide <a href="https://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a>
    email, desired price and product title.</p>

    <h4>2. Share payment URL</h4>
    <p>Simply share the "Buy Now" URL with your friends or potential customers
    among other product details. For example, you can <a href="https://twitter.com" target="_blank">Tweet</a> it,
    share on <a href="https://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>,
    send by email or simply post to your blog.</p>

    <h3>3. Get paid instantly!</h3>
    <p>Because we believe you deserve it! You are the owner of digital goods and
    you are the seller, which means customers will be paying you directly through
    <a href="https://www.paypal.com" target="_blank">PayPal</a> with no 'man in the middle'.</p>
